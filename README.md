PIG

This was a quick and easy game I made to help learn some basic JS, HTML, and CSS.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to get to 100.
Everytime you click 'roll dice', a dice will randomly show one of it's sides and that to your current score for that turn.
If you roll a '1', you do not add any points to your total score for that turn, and it is now the other players turn.
If you click 'hold', the points collected for that turn will be added to your total score, and it will then be the other players turn.

Clicking 'new game' will start the game over.
